Description: 

Ends the current actors turn in a combat encounter. Useful when you don't pop out your combat tracker
and want to end the turn from your hotbar.

If the user is a gamemaster, it will always end the current turn. For players, it will only end 
the turn when the current actor in the turn order is owned by you.
